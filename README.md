# 🧚 Fairy OS

**Fairy OS** is an experimental operating system that integrates **AI capabilities** at its core — aiming to blur the boundary between system software and intelligent computing.

---

## 🌟 Overview

Fairy OS is a next-gen OS project designed from the ground up to:
- Provide native support for **AI-enhanced user experiences**
- Explore how artificial intelligence can manage, optimize, and assist with system operations
- Serve as a platform for experimenting with intelligent task scheduling, adaptive UI, and contextual automation

> This is a personal learning and research project, combining OS development with artificial intelligence.

---

## 🧠 Goals

- Integrate AI modules directly into system services
- Enable real-time contextual assistance for users
- Explore autonomous system behavior (self-healing, predictive resource management)
- Learn low-level OS design and AI embedding techniques

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C/C++** for low-level OS core
- **Assembly** for bootloader and hardware interfacing
- **Python / Rust** for AI subsystem (future plan)
- **QEMU / VirtualBox** for testing
- **Custom build tools & scripts**
